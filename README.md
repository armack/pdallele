``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("armack/pdallele")
```

No CRAN release in planned.

## Example

This contains all the code the code used to generate the tables and figures in
"Î²-Lactamase Diversity in *Acinetobacter baumannii* and *Pseudomonas
aeruginosa*: A Bioinformatic Analysis" by Mack et al.

Data downloading, processing, and cleanup was performed as outlined in
`vignette("downloading-data", package = "pdallele")` and
`vignette("processing-data", package = "pdallele")`.

The code used for analysis and generation of tables and figures is included in
`vignette("sample-analysis"", package = "pdallele")` and
`vignette("additional-analysis", package = "pdallele")`.
